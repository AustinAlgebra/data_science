# Education Finance A/B Testing

In this project I took school funding data from districts across the US. As a current HS teacher I was interested in how my district compared to neighboring districts in Colorado. Was there a significant difference between my district's funding and neighboring districts? I'm also interested in how funding differs for rural schools compared to urban schools in Colorado. Colorado contains a couple urban regions, but much of the area of the state is very rural. Was there a significant difference in funding of urban versus rural schools in Colorado?

In this project, one challenge was the number of observations. I ended up using mostly non-parametric tests to determine if there was a significant difference between the A and B sets.
